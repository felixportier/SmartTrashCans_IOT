# 🚛 Smart TrashCans 
## ⚙️ An IOT project using Arduino + ESP8266

_The aim of this project was to create a circuit that included 3 different sensors ( Tilt sensor , Ultra-Sonic distance sensor and a IR-avoidance sensor ) to track the state of trash cans ( Full, Empty and Tilted ).
The data is sent to an exterior API using the ESP8266 everytime a sensor's value changes._

Feel free to checkout the code / schematics and reuse them for your projects !
