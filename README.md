# SmartTrashCans_IOT
An IOT project using Arduino + ESP8266

The aim of this project was to create circuit that included 3 different sensors ( Tilt sensor , Ultra-Sonic distance sensor and a IR-avoidance sensor ) to track the state of trash cans ( Full, Empty and Tilted ).
The data is then sent to an exterior API using the ESP8266.
